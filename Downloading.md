# Downloading

To download the CrossPlay installer, go to [the Patreon page](https://patreon.goldsrc.one/) and follow [the download links](https://www.patreon.com/posts/v3-137086236)).

Since the installer is not signed, you will probably need to ignore about 8000 security warnings in order to download the exe and run it.
